# JavaScript Hoisting Issues - Final Fix

## 🚨 Issues Identified

1. **`fetchChats` hoisting error** - Line 126/158
2. **`loadChatMessages` hoisting error** - Line 223/246  

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Root Cause:** React functional components with `useCallback` are subject to JavaScript's temporal dead zone. Functions were being called in useEffect hooks before they were defined.

**Fix:** Reorganized component structure to define all callback functions before any useEffect hooks that use them.

### New Function Order:
```javascript
1. Event handlers (handleNewMessage, handleMessageSent, etc.)
2. Main functions (fetchChats, loadChatMessages) 
3. useEffect hooks that use the functions
4. Other utility functions
5. Component render
```

### Functions Moved/Fixed:
- ✅ `fetchChats` - Moved to line ~99 (before useEffect at line ~180)
- ✅ `loadChatMessages` - Moved to line ~118 (before useEffect at line ~237)
- ✅ Removed duplicate function definitions
- ✅ All dependencies properly maintained

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Refresh the page** completely
3. **Login again** 
4. **Navigate to chat** - should load without JavaScript errors
5. **Check console** for connection messages:
   ```
   Initializing Socket.IO connection...
   Setting up Socket.IO event listeners...
   Socket connected: [socket-id]
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

- ✅ **No JavaScript errors** in console
- ✅ **Chat component loads** successfully  
- ✅ **Socket.IO connects** properly
- ✅ **All functions work** as expected
- ✅ **Real-time messaging** functional

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run in browser console after login:
```javascript
// Check if functions are accessible
console.log(typeof window.debugSocket) // should be 'object'
window.debugSocket.status() // should show connection status
```
