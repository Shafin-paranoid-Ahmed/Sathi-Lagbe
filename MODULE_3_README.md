- **Course Mapping**: Links specific courses to classroom timeslots
- **Occupancy Tracking**: Tracks which classrooms are occupied during specific times

### 2. Advanced Filtering System
- **Floor-based Filtering**: Filter classrooms by specific floors
- **Capacity Range Filtering**: Filter by minimum and maximum capacity
- **Building Filtering**: Filter by building name
- **Room Type Filtering**: Filter by classroom type (Classroom, Lab, Conference, Seminar)
- **Facilities Filtering**: Filter by available facilities (Projector, AC, Whiteboard, etc.)
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by availability status

### 3. Time-based Availability
- **Timeslot Management**: Check availability for specific time slots
- **Day-wise Scheduling**: View availability for different days of the week
- **Real-time Updates**: Live availability status updates

### 4. Statistics and Analytics

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the data seeder to populate sample data
cd server
node seed-classroom-data.js
```

### 2. Server Setup
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Client Setup
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access Module 3
1. Navigate to the Classrooms page
2. Click "Module 3: Enhanced View" button
3. Explore the different tabs and features

## 📊 Sample Data Structure

The seeder creates classrooms with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  roomNumber: '101',
  building: 'Building A',
  floor: 1,
  capacity: 30,
  status: 'Available',
  roomType: 'Classroom',
  facilities: ['Projector', 'AC', 'Whiteboard'],
  timetable: {
    schedule: {
      monday: [
        { timeSlot: '08:00-09:20', course: 'CSE341-02-SBAW-10A-04C', isOccupied: true },
        { timeSlot: '09:30-10:50', course: '', isOccupied: false }
      ]
      // ... other days
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Classroom View
- View all classrooms with basic information
- See availability status at a glance
- Quick actions like "Set All to Available"

### 2. Enhanced Module 3 View
- **All Classrooms Tab**: View all classrooms with advanced filtering
- **Time-based Availability Tab**: Check availability for specific timeslots
- **Statistics Tab**: View comprehensive analytics
- **Advanced Filters Tab**: Apply multiple filter criteria

### 3. Filtering Examples
```javascript
// Filter by floor and capacity
filters = {
  floor: 2,
  minCapacity: 30,
  maxCapacity: 60
}

// Filter by building and facilities
filters = {
  building: 'Building A',
  facilities: 'Projector,AC'
}

// Filter by room type and status
filters = {
  roomType: 'Lab',
  status: 'Available'
}
```

4. **Filter not working**: Check filter parameters are correct

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check server logs
cd server && npm run dev

# Check database connection
node -e "require('mongoose').connect(process.env.MONGO_URI).then(() => console.log('Connected')).catch(console.error)"
